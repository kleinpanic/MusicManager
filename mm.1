.SH NAME
mm \- advanced media management tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mm
[OPERATION] [OPTIONS] <path>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Music Manager is a Bash script designed to help you manage your media collection with minimal dependencies. It supports compressing, uncompressing, converting, scanning, and managing metadata of media files while preserving the original directory structure.
.SH OPERATIONS
.IP "--compress <directory>"
Recursively compresses all supported media files (MP3, WAV, AAC, FLAC, OGG, OPUS, MP4, mov) in the specified directory. Compressed files are stored in a subdirectory named "compressed". An optional flag, 
.B --package,
can be used to bundle all compressed files into a single container archive.
.IP "--uncompress <path>"
Recursively extracts all .7z archives (or unpacks a packaged archive) from the specified path into an "uncompressed" folder, preserving the original directory structure.
.IP "--convert <file|directory>"
Converts media files to a target codec. By default, the target codec is opus.
.TP
.B --to <codec>
Specifies the target codec.
.TP
.B --keep
Retains the original files by placing converted files in a new folder (e.g. "converted_opus") that mirrors the original directory structure.
.TP
.B --replace
Replaces the original files with the converted files (only if no data loss is expected).
.TP
.B --quiet
Suppresses detailed debug output during conversion.
.TP
.B --metadata <mode>
Controls metadata handling. Modes are:
.IP "keep (default)"
Copy all metadata tags.
.IP "drop"
Remove all metadata.
.IP "drop:tag,tag..."
Remove only the specified tags.
Note: The older --from flag has been removed.
.IP "--scan <file|directory>"
Recursively scans media files. For each file, ffprobe extracts detailed metadata including container, codec, sample rate, bitrate, duration, and filesize. An expected filesize is computed and compared with
the actual filesize (with a 1.5× threshold). The file is then classified as:
.TP
.I Normal 
(if the filesize is within the expected threshold; displayed in green).
.TP
.I Weird 
(if the filesize exceeds the threshold; displayed in yellow/orange).
.TP
.I Corrupted 
(if the file is not validated by ffprobe; displayed in red).
The scan results are both displayed on screen (with ANSI colors, if supported) and logged to a timestamped report file.
.IP "--metadata-manage <path>"
Allows management of metadata for media files.
.TP
.B --add "key=value,key2=value2,..."
Adds or updates specified metadata tags.
.TP
.B --remove "tag,tag,..."
Removes the specified metadata tags.
.IP "--install"
Installs the mm script, manpage, and bash completion into the appropriate system or local directories.
.IP "--uninstall"
Removes the installed script, manpage, and bash completion file.
.IP "--help"
Displays this help message.
.IP "--version"
Displays version information.
