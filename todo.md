# TODO

For the ffprobe command there are two entries for bit_rate, one is N/A or NAN possibly, idk if this is corruption, failure to convert properly, or otherwise. Either fix convertion to make sure that convertion is done properly and bit_rate is defined either twice as the same number or only once bc right now its defined twice with differing values for each. Additionally, if this is normaly just update the --scan function.
